## Overview

**BelIS online** (Beleuchtungs-Informations-System online) is an open-source project initiated by the city of Wuppertal, aiming to meet the demands of urban lighting management efficiently. It offers a practical solution by focusing on offline availability, enabling the management and evaluation of data associated with city lighting seamlessly. BelIS is actively utilized by the department 104 of the city of Wuppertal, Stadtwerke Wuppertal, and the current contract partner SPIE AG on a daily basis.

## Objective

This project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive tool to ease the daily operations of maintenance companies and urban stakeholders by improving reliability, efficiency, and user experience in managing urban lighting data.

## Transition to PWA

Originally conceived as a native iOS application that required a constant internet connection, BelIS transitioned into a Single Page Progressive Web App (PWA) with an offline-first approach. This transition is pivotal, addressing operational challenges and enhancing the application's adaptability and functionality.
